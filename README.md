## Description

1. This is a simple NFT marketplace game app that allows users to buy NFTs. When a NFT is purchased, the first person to find the admin of the app and have him scan the QR code wins the NFT and only this user will be able to have it. 

2. Another feature of this app is the real-time stock tracker that shows the market for one of the most popular companies including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and much more. 


## Get started

   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=postgres
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres

   - Open Docker

   - In backend/ run:

   ```bash

   ```
